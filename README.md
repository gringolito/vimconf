Vim and GVim personalizations

This is my vim configuration settings, this also includes many plugins
and a pack of most vim colorschemes. Suit yourself.

Most of the configurations are commented, so it should be easy enough
to edit it.

If you want a easy way to install and maintain your own configuration
install the settings using the 'install_config.sh' script, it will do
symlinks to the versioned files to your home dir. If you do any
modifications and dont want to keep getting updates from me (or at
least want to see them before applying) create a branch for yourself
and use it, when there are updates from me just merge my stuff with
your branch.
(dont version stuff like your viminfo or .netrwhist as it may contain
 sensitive information).

No license, just use it, if you modify it, its yours, I dont take any
responsability from the usage or distribution of this, if this thing
eats your kitten or causes a nuclear war its your fault.
Respect the plugins, colorschemes or other stuff that I may have used
licenses as those stuff does not belong to me.

Enjoy.
